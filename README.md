Cello
======

Cello is a simple program to simulate a two-dimensional cellular automaton.
The generated square or rectangular pattern can be used as data matrix.
A square pattern has always the dihedral symmetry group D4.


Run Script
----------

    ./cello.py generates pattern bitmaps in the ./bitmaps directory

    Optional Parameters:
    -x horizontal size of the grid, should be an odd number
    -y vertical size of the grid, should be an odd number defaults to x value
    -b minimal neighbors to make a live cell
    -d maximum neighbors for a live cell
